Mod for starsector

Download and put everything on folder of same name on 
Fractal Softworks\Starsector\mods\RageAndPassion

1. Start starsector
2. On the initial management screen, go to MODS before starting the game
3. Enable the mod
4. Should immediately be able to run.
On my computer it runs properly as soon as its on the folder. No other mods required. Hopefully Im notified if its misbehaving?

Current stuff added
Ships:
Phase wolf
Phase/shield wolf

Hullmods:
Overload cloak
Reflector shield


This is a work in progress and subject to change often. All hullmods are instantly added to known ones as of 7/7/2025

Some things compile in java 7 for a reason I cannot fathom, since the game v98a is supposed to be on 17?!
